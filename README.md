Jen tackles *Project Euler*
============

[Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net) is an online experiment in inductive learning.  A series of challenging math problems designed to be solved on computers are laid out in a progressive order, with later problems building on the tools and ideas that you develop for earlier ones.  

This is where I'll be putting my solutions so I can keep track of my progress.  My personal goals for participation are to find concise solutions that make intelligent use of elements in the Python standard library that I haven't used extensively in the past, especially `itertools` and `operator`.  I feel slightly guilty about contradicting the wishes of the official Project Euler FAQ, but numerous people besides me have already had *their* solutions up on github for months or years. 

I'll just say this:  **If you're looking for answers because you're stuck on a problem, stop for a moment and think about why you are doing what you're doing.** I've cheated on enough games in my life to know that it ruins everything.  Don't do it.

On the other hand, if you've already done them and want to compare notes that's cool.  Suggestions for improvement are welcome and encouraged.  

**Think my code sucks?  Awesome. Tell me how I can improve.**
