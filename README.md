Jen tackles *Project Euler*
============

This is where I'll put my solutions to Project Euler problems.  If you're looking for answers because you're stuck on a problem, *don't do it!* I've cheated on enough things in my life to know that it ruins the game.  

On the other hand, if you've already done them and want to compare notes that's cool.  Suggestions for improvement are welcome and encouraged.  

**Think my code sucks?  Awesome. Tell me how I can improve.**
